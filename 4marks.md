## 1. Differentiate between Flowchart and DFD

**Flowchart:**

- **Definition:** A flowchart is a visual representation of a process that shows the steps involved and their sequence. It uses various shapes to represent different elements, such as processes, decision points, and data inputs/outputs.
- **Components:** Flowcharts use symbols like rectangles (processes), diamonds (decisions), ovals (start/end points), and arrows (flow of control).
- **Focus:** Primarily focuses on the sequence of steps and the logical flow of a process.
- **Usage:** Widely used for representing algorithmic processes, programming logic, and business workflows.

**DFD (Data Flow Diagram):**

- **Definition:** A DFD is a diagram that represents the flow of data within a system. It illustrates how data moves between processes, data stores, and external entities.
- **Components:** DFDs use symbols like circles (processes), rectangles (data stores), arrows (data flow), and ovals (external entities).
- **Focus:** Primarily focuses on the data movement and transformations within a system.
- **Usage:** Commonly used in system analysis and design to model the flow of data in information systems.

**Key Difference:**

- **Focus Difference:** Flowcharts focus on the overall process flow, including actions and decisions. DFDs focus on the flow of data between different components in a system.

## 2. Write the difference between Table Layout and Frame Layout

**Table Layout:**

- **Definition:** Table Layout is a layout manager in Android that arranges UI components in a table-like structure with rows and columns.
- **Usage:** Suitable for arranging UI elements in a grid, especially when a grid-like structure is needed, such as for forms or data entry.
- **Components:** Uses `<TableRow>` to define rows, and within rows, UI components are placed using `<TextView>`, `<EditText>`, etc.
- **Flexibility:** Provides flexibility in designing complex layouts with a combination of rows and columns.

**Frame Layout:**

- **Definition:** Frame Layout is a simple layout manager in Android that is designed to hold a single child view at a time.
- **Usage:** Suitable for scenarios where only one child view needs to be displayed, such as for fragments or single views.
- **Components:** Allows the placement of a single child view at the top-left corner, and additional views overlap the existing one.
- **Flexibility:** While less flexible than Table Layout for grid-like structures, it is useful for simple scenarios requiring a single view.

**Key Difference:**

- **Layout Structure:** Table Layout is designed for organizing views in a table/grid structure with rows and columns. Frame Layout is designed to hold a single child view, and additional views overlap the existing one.

## 3. Explain Content Provider

**Content Provider:**

- **Definition:** A Content Provider is an Android component that manages and exposes structured sets of data to applications. It acts as an interface for data exchange between different apps.
- **Purpose:** Enables secure and consistent access to data from one app to another, promoting data sharing while maintaining data integrity.
- **Components:** Consists of methods to query, insert, update, and delete data. It is associated with a unique URI to identify the data it manages.
- **Security:** Content Providers implement permissions and access controls to regulate which apps can interact with the data they expose.
- **Example Use Cases:** Contacts, calendar events, and media files are often exposed through content providers.

## 4. Explain Material Design

**Material Design:**

- **Definition:** Material Design is a design language developed by Google that provides guidelines for creating visually appealing and consistent user interfaces across different platforms and devices.
- **Key Principles:**

    private static final String COLUMN_ID = "pid";
    private static final String COLUMN_NAME = "pname";
    private static final String COLUMN_CATEGORY = "pcategory";
    private static final String COLUMN_PRICE = "pprice";

    public ProductDatabaseHelper(Context context) {
        super(context, DATABASE_NAME, null, DATABASE_VERSION);
    }

    @Override
    public void onCreate(SQLiteDatabase db) {
        String createTableQuery = "CREATE TABLE " + TABLE_PRODUCT + " (" +
                COLUMN_ID + " INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, " +
                COLUMN_NAME + " TEXT, " +
                COLUMN_CATEGORY + " TEXT, " +
                COLUMN_PRICE + " REAL)";
        db.execSQL(createTableQuery);
    }

    @Override

## 9. Define: Class, Object, Encapsulation, Inheritance

**Class:**

- **Definition:** A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects in object-oriented programming (OOP). It defines a set of attributes (data members) and methods (functions) that characterize any object created from that class.

**Object:**

- **Definition:** An object is an instance of a class. It is a runtime entity that represents a real-world entity. Objects have state (attributes) and behavior (methods), as defined by the class from which they are instantiated.

**Encapsulation:**

- **Definition:** Encapsulation is an OOP concept that refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It restricts access to some of the object's components and prevents direct modification, promoting data hiding and abstraction.

**Inheritance:**

- **Definition:** Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP that allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class (superclass or base class). It facilitates code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

## 10. Explain basic building blocks/components of Android Application

The basic building blocks/components of an Android application include:

1. **Activity:**
   - An Activity represents a single screen with a user interface. It is a crucial component for user interaction and serves as an entry point to the application.

2. **Service:**
   - A Service is a background component that performs operations without a user interface. It runs independently of the UI and can continue running even if the app is in the background.

3. **Broadcast Receiver:**
   - A Broadcast Receiver is a component that responds to system-wide broadcast announcements or custom broadcasts. It can perform actions based on events like incoming calls, low battery, etc.

4. **Content Provider:**
   - A Content Provider manages and exposes data to other applications. It allows data sharing and access control between different apps, promoting data integrity.

## 11. List out various layouts available in Android. Explain any one in detail

**Various Layouts in Android:**

1. **Linear Layout:** Arranges child views in a single line, either horizontally or vertically.
2. **Relative Layout:** Positions child views relative to each other or to the parent.
3. **Constraint Layout:** Allows building complex layouts with a flat view hierarchy and supports constraints to define relationships between views.
4. **Frame Layout:** Designed to hold a single child view, with additional views overlapping the existing one.
5. **Table Layout:** Organizes child views into rows and columns, similar to an HTML table.

**Explanation of Linear Layout:**

- **Definition:** Linear Layout arranges its child views in a linear orientation, either horizontally or vertically.
- **Attributes:**
  - `android:orientation`: Specifies the orientation (horizontal or vertical).
  - `android:layout_width` and `android:layout_height`: Define the width and height of the layout.
  - `android:gravity`: Sets the gravity of the content within the layout (e.g., center, top, bottom).
- **Example:**

  ```xml
  <LinearLayout
      xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
      android:layout_width="match_parent"
      android:layout_height="match_parent"
      android:orientation="vertical"
      android:gravity="center">

      <TextView
          android:layout_width="wrap_content"
          android:layout_height="wrap_content"
          android:text="Hello, Linear Layout!"
          android:textSize="20sp"/>

      <Button
          android:layout_width="wrap_content"
          android:layout_height="wrap_content"
          android:text="Click me"/>
  </LinearLayout>
  ```

  In this example, child views (TextView and Button) are arranged vertically within the Linear Layout. The `android:orientation` attribute is set to "vertical," and the `android:gravity` attribute is set to "center" for centering the content.

## 12. Write code to display Toast Message on click of Button

```java
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.view.View;
import android.widget.Button;
import android.widget.Toast;
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        Button clickButton = findViewById(R.id.clickButton);

        // Set a click listener on the button
        clickButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View v) {
                // Display a Toast message on button click
                Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, "Button Clicked!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
            }
        });
    }
}
```

In this example:

- The `Button` with the id `clickButton` is defined in the XML layout (assumed to be named `activity_main.xml`).
- In the `onCreate` method, a click listener is set on the button using `setOnClickListener`.
- When the button is clicked, a Toast message is displayed using `Toast.makeText`. The `makeText` method takes the context (`MainActivity.this`), the message string ("Button Clicked!"), and the duration of the Toast display (`Toast.LENGTH_SHORT`).
- Finally, `show()` is called to display the Toast message.

## 13. Explain Internal vs. External storage

**Internal Storage:**

- **Definition:** Internal storage refers to the device's built-in storage that is not removable by the user. It is used to store private data specific to the application.
- **Access:** Only the app that created the data can access it. Other apps or users cannot access the internal storage of an app directly.
- **Path:** The path to internal storage is typically obtained using `getFilesDir()` or `getCacheDir()` methods in Android.

**External Storage:**

- **Definition:** External storage refers to a storage space that can be used to store files that are accessible by other apps and users. It includes the device's external SD card or a portion of the internal storage designated as external.
- **Access:** Data stored in external storage can be read and written by other apps, and users can access the files using file managers.
- **Path:** The path to external storage is obtained using `getExternalStorageDirectory()` or `getExternalFilesDir()` methods.

**Comparison:**

- **Security:** Internal storage is more secure, as it is private to the app. External storage is less secure, and sensitive data should be avoided in external storage.
- **Accessibility:** Internal storage is specific to the app, while external storage allows data sharing between apps.
- **Removability:** External storage might be removable (e.g., SD card), while internal storage is typically fixed.

## 14. Discuss AsyncTask in detail

**AsyncTask in Android:**

- **Definition:** AsyncTask is an Android class that simplifies the execution of operations in the background thread and the handling of UI updates on the main thread.
- **Key Components:**
  - **`doInBackground()`:** This method performs background computation and returns the result.
  - **`onPreExecute()`:** Executed on the UI thread before `doInBackground()`. Used for setup tasks.
  - **`onPostExecute()`:** Executed on the UI thread after `doInBackground()`. Receives the result and updates the UI.
  - **`onProgressUpdate()`:** Called on the UI thread when `publishProgress()` is invoked in `doInBackground()`. Used for updating UI during the background task.

**Example of AsyncTask:**

```java
import android.os.AsyncTask;

public class MyAsyncTask extends AsyncTask<Void, Integer, String> {

    @Override
    protected void onPreExecute() {
        // Perform setup tasks on the UI thread
    }

    @Override
    protected String doInBackground(Void... params) {
        // Perform background computation
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            // Simulate progress by publishing updates
            publishProgress(i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(500); // Simulate time-consuming task
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
        return "Task completed";
    }

    @Override
    protected void onProgressUpdate(Integer... values) {
        // Update UI with progress information
    }

    @Override
    protected void onPostExecute(String result) {
        // Update UI with the result of the background computation
    }
}
```

To execute the AsyncTask:

```java
new MyAsyncTask().execute();
```

In this example, `MyAsyncTask` performs a background task (simulated by a loop) and updates the UI using `publishProgress()` and the corresponding `onProgressUpdate()` method.

## 15. What is Geocoding and Reverse Geocoding? Explain it with an example

**Geocoding:**

- **Definition:** Geocoding is the process of converting a human-readable address (like "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA") into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).
- **Example:**

  ```java
  Geocoder geocoder = new Geocoder(context, Locale.getDefault());
  List<Address> addresses = geocoder.getFromLocationName("1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA", 1);

  if (addresses != null && addresses.size() > 0) {
      double latitude = addresses.get(0).getLatitude();
      double longitude = addresses.get(0).getLongitude();
      // Use the obtained latitude and longitude
  }
  ```

**Reverse Geocoding:**

- **Definition:** Reverse Geocoding is the process of converting geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) into a human-readable address.
- **Example:**

  ```java
  Geocoder geocoder = new Geocoder(context, Locale.getDefault());
  List<Address> addresses = geocoder.getFromLocation(latitude, longitude, 1);

  if (addresses != null && addresses.size() > 0) {
      String addressLine = addresses.get(0).getAddressLine(0);
      // Use the obtained address information
  }
  ```

In both examples, the `Geocoder` class is used. For Geocoding, the `getFromLocationName` method is employed, while for Reverse Geocoding, the `getFromLocation` method is used. The obtained `Address` object provides details like latitude, longitude, address lines, and more.

## 16. What is Service? Discuss various Service life cycle methods in detail

**Service in Android:**

- **Definition:** A Service is a component that performs operations in the background without a user interface. It is used for long-running tasks, such as playing music, downloading files, or handling network operations.

**Service Life Cycle Methods:**

1. **`onCreate()`:**
   - Called when the service is first created.
   - Initialization tasks, like setting up resources, can be performed here.

2. **`onStartCommand(Intent, int, int)`:**
   - Called when the service is started using `startService()`.
   - Handles the incoming `Intent` and performs the necessary background tasks.
   - The return value indicates how the system should behave after the service is killed.

3. **`onBind(Intent)`:**
   - Called when another component wants to bind with the service using `bindService()`.
   - Returns an `IBinder` interface, allowing communication between the service and the bound component.

4. **`onUnbind(Intent)`:**
   - Called when all clients have disconnected from a bound service.
   - Provides an opportunity to clean up resources associated with the service.

5. **`onRebind(Intent)`:**
   - Called when a new client is connected to a previously unbound service

6. **`onDestroy()`:**
   - Called when the service is no longer used and is being destroyed.
   - Cleanup tasks, such as releasing resources, should be performed here.

**Example:**

```java
public class MyService extends Service {

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        // Initialization tasks
    }

    @Override
    public int onStartCommand(Intent intent, int flags, int startId) {
        // Background tasks
        return START_STICKY; // Service will be restarted if it gets terminated
    }

    @Override
    public IBinder onBind(Intent intent) {
        // Return an IBinder interface for bound services
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean onUnbind(Intent intent) {
        // Cleanup tasks when all clients have disconnected
        return super.onUnbind(intent);
    }

    @Override
    public void onDestroy() {
        // Cleanup tasks before the service is destroyed
    }
}
```

In this example, `MyService` extends the `Service` class and overrides various life cycle methods. The `onStartCommand` method is often used for background tasks.

## 17. Enlist and define the components of an Android application

1. **Activity:**
   - **Definition:** An Activity represents a single screen with a user interface. It is a crucial component for user interaction and serves as an entry point to the application.

2. **Service:**

3. **Broadcast Receiver:**
   - **Definition:** A Broadcast Receiver is a component that responds to system-wide broadcast announcements or custom broadcasts. It can perform actions based on events like incoming calls, low battery, etc.

4. **Content Provider:**
   - **Definition:** A Content Provider manages and exposes data to other applications. It allows data sharing and access control between different apps, promoting data integrity.

## 18. What is AndroidManifest.xml? Write its usages with an example

**AndroidManifest.xml:**

- **Definition:** AndroidManifest.xml is an essential configuration file in an Android application. It provides essential information about the app to the Android system, the runtime environment, and other apps.

**Usages:**

1. **Package Declaration:**
   - Specifies the unique identifier for the app using the `package` attribute.

   ```xml
   <manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
       package="com.example.myapp">
   ```

2. **Application Components:**
   - Declares the components of the application, including activities, services, broadcast receivers, and content providers.

   ```xml
   <application>
       <activity android:name=".MainActivity">
           <!-- Intent filters and other activity-specific configurations -->
       </activity>
       <!-- Other components like services, broadcast receivers, and content providers -->
   </application>
   ```

3. **Permissions:**
   - Specifies the permissions required by the app. Users are informed about these permissions during installation.

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
   ```

4. **Intent Filters:**
   - Declares the intent filters for activities, broadcast receivers, and services, defining how they respond to implicit intents.

   ```xml
   <activity android:name=".MainActivity">
       <intent-filter>
           <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
           <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
       </intent-filter>
   </activity>
   ```

## 19. Discuss the need for permissions in Android. Write the permissions required to set system functionalities like Bluetooth, camera, internet

**Need for Permissions in Android:**

- **Security:** Permissions protect users' privacy and data by restricting the capabilities of apps. They ensure that apps have explicit consent to access sensitive resources or perform specific actions.
- **User Control:** Permissions empower users to control what data and resources apps can access. Users grant or deny permissions during the app installation or runtime.

**Example Permissions:**

1. **Bluetooth:**
   - Permission: `BLUETOOTH`
   - Required for accessing Bluetooth functionality.

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />
   ```

2. **Camera:**
   - Permission: `CAMERA`
   - Required for accessing the device's camera.

   ```xml
   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
   ```

3. **Internet:**
   - Permission: `INTERNET`
   - Required for accessing the internet, making network requests.

   <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
   ```

## 20. Explain the concept of RecyclerView. Write down the steps to implement RecyclerView in an Android application

**RecyclerView Concept:**

- **Definition:** RecyclerView is a flexible and efficient replacement for ListView. It is a container for displaying large sets of data efficiently by recycling and reusing view elements.

**Steps to Implement RecyclerView:**

1. **Add RecyclerView to Layout:**
   - Include the RecyclerView widget in the XML layout file where you want to display the list.

   ```xml
   <androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView
       android:id="@+id/recyclerView"
       android:layout_width="match_parent"
       android:layout_height="match_parent" />
   ```

2. **Create a Layout for Each Item:**
   - Create an XML layout file representing the layout of each item in the RecyclerView.

   ```xml
   <!-- item_layout.xml -->
   <LinearLayout
       xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
       android:layout_width="match_parent"
       android:layout_height="wrap_content">

       <!-- Item views (TextViews, ImageViews, etc.) -->

   </LinearLayout>
   ```

3. **Create a ViewHolder:**
   - Create a ViewHolder class that holds references to the views within each item layout.

   ```java
   public class MyViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {
       // Views within the item layout
       public TextView textView;

       public MyViewHolder(View itemView) {
           super(itemView);
           // Initialize views
           textView = itemView.findViewById(R.id.textView);
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Create an Adapter:**
   - Create an adapter class that extends `RecyclerView.Adapter` and overrides necessary methods.

   ```java
   public class MyAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter<MyViewHolder> {

       @Override
       public MyViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {
           View itemView = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext())
               .inflate(R.layout.item_layout, parent, false);
           return new MyViewHolder(itemView);
       }

       @Override
       public void onBindViewHolder(MyViewHolder holder, int position) {
           // Bind data to views based on the position
       }

       @Override
       public int

    getItemCount() {
            // Return the number of items in the dataset
            return 0;
        }
    }

   ```

5. **Set Layout Manager and Adapter in Activity/Fragment:**
   - In the activity or fragment, set the layout manager and adapter for the RecyclerView.

   ```java
   RecyclerView recyclerView = findViewById(R.id.recyclerView);
   LinearLayoutManager layoutManager = new LinearLayoutManager(this);
   recyclerView.setLayoutManager(layoutManager);

   MyAdapter adapter = new MyAdapter();
   recyclerView.setAdapter(adapter);
   ```

6. **Provide Data to the Adapter:**
   - Populate the adapter with data, and notify the adapter when the dataset changes.

   ```java
   List<DataModel> dataList = getData(); // Replace with actual data
   adapter.setDataList(dataList);
   adapter.notifyDataSetChanged();
   ```

With these steps, you've implemented a basic RecyclerView in an Android application. Adjustments can be made based on specific requirements, such as handling item click events or adding animations.

## 21. What do you mean by AsyncTask? Explain with an example

**AsyncTask in Android:**

- **Definition:** AsyncTask is an Android class that simplifies the execution of operations in the background thread and the handling of UI updates on the main thread.

**Example:**

Here's a simple example of using AsyncTask to perform a background task and update the UI.

**MyAsyncTask.java:**

```java
import android.os.AsyncTask;

public class MyAsyncTask extends AsyncTask<Void, Void, String> {

    @Override
    protected void onPreExecute() {
        // Perform setup tasks on the UI thread before background execution
    }

    @Override
    protected String doInBackground(Void... params) {
        // Background computation, not on the UI thread
        // This method receives parameters (Void... params) and returns a result (String in this case)
        return "Task completed";
    }

    @Override
    protected void onPostExecute(String result) {
        // Update UI with the result of the background computation
        // This method is called on the UI thread
    }
}
```

**MainActivity.java:**

```java
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.view.View;
import android.widget.Button;
import android.widget.Toast;
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        Button executeButton = findViewById(R.id.executeButton);

        // Set a click listener on the button
        executeButton.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(View v) {
                // Execute the AsyncTask when the button is clicked
                new MyAsyncTask().execute();
            }
        });
    }
}
```

In this example, `MyAsyncTask` extends `AsyncTask`, and the methods `onPreExecute`, `doInBackground`, and `onPostExecute` are overridden. The background computation in `doInBackground` runs on a separate thread, while UI updates in `onPostExecute` happen on the main thread.

## 22. Can we use the mobile screen as a Canvas to draw any shapes on it? Write the steps for using Graphics objects in an Android application

**Using Graphics Objects in Android:**

Yes, you can use the mobile screen as a Canvas to draw shapes in an Android application. Here are the steps:

1. **Create a Custom View:**
   - Create a custom view class that extends `View` and override the `onDraw` method.

   ```java
   public class MyCanvasView extends View {

       public MyCanvasView(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) {
           super(context, attrs);
       }

       @Override
       protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {
           super.onDraw(canvas);
           // Draw shapes using canvas methods (drawRect, drawCircle, drawLine, etc.)
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Draw Shapes on Canvas:**
   - In the `onDraw` method, use the `Canvas` object to draw shapes.

   ```java
   @Override
   protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {
       super.onDraw(canvas);

       Paint paint = new Paint();
       paint.setColor(Color.BLUE);
       paint.setStyle(Paint.Style.FILL);

       // Draw a rectangle
       canvas.drawRect(50, 50, 200, 200, paint);

       // Draw a circle
       canvas.drawCircle(300, 150, 100, paint);
   }
   ```

3. **Include Custom View in Layout:**
   - Include the custom view in your layout XML file.

   ```xml
   <com.example.myapp.MyCanvasView
       android:id="@+id/myCanvasView"
       android:layout_width="match_parent"
       android:layout_height="match_parent" />
   ```

4. **Access Custom View in Activity:**
   - In your activity, access the custom view and use it.

   ```java
   MyCanvasView myCanvasView = findViewById(R.id.myCanvasView);
   ```

5. **Redraw the Canvas (Optional):**
   - If you need to update the drawing, you can trigger a redraw.

   ```java
   myCanvasView.invalidate();
   ```

## 23. Write a program to locate the user’s current location. (Write ONLY .java and manifest file)

**MainActivity.java:**

```java
import android.Manifest;
import android.content.Context;
import android.content.pm.PackageManager;
import android.location.Location;
import android.location.LocationListener;
import android.location.LocationManager;
import android.os.Bundle;
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;
import androidx.core.app.ActivityCompat;

public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    private LocationManager locationManager;
    private LocationListener locationListener;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        // Initialize LocationManager and LocationListener
        locationManager = (LocationManager) getSystemService(Context.LOCATION_SERVICE);
        locationListener = new LocationListener() {
            @Override
            public void onLocationChanged(Location location) {
                // Handle location changes
                double latitude = location.getLatitude();
                double longitude = location.getLongitude();
                // Do something with latitude and longitude
            }

            @Override
            public void onStatusChanged(String provider, int status, Bundle extras) {
            }

            @Override
            public void onProviderEnabled(String provider) {
            }

            @Override
            public void onProviderDisabled(String provider) {
            }
        };

        // Check for location permission
        if (ActivityCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION)
                != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED
                && ActivityCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, Manifest.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION)
                != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
            // Request location permission
            ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(this,
                    new String[]{Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, Manifest.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION},
                    1);
        } else {
            // Start listening for location updates
            locationManager.requestLocationUpdates(LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER, 0, 0, locationListener);
        }
    }

    @Override
    protected void onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy();
        // Stop listening for location updates when the activity is destroyed
        locationManager.removeUpdates(locationListener);
    }
}
```

**AndroidManifest.xml:**

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.myapp">

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />

    <application>
        <!-- Application components, activities, etc. -->
        <activity android:name=".MainActivity">
            <!-- Activity configuration, intent filters, etc. -->
        </activity>
    </application>

</manifest>
```

This program uses the `LocationManager` and `LocationListener` to obtain the user's current location. It also requests location permissions in the manifest file. Note that location updates may require additional considerations, such as handling runtime permission requests and managing the lifecycle of location updates.
