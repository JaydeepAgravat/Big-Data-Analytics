3. **Bucketing in Hive:**

   - **Definition:**

     - Bucketing involves dividing data into fixed-size buckets based on the hash value of a chosen column. Each bucket represents a subset of the data, and the number of buckets is specified during table creation.

   - **Syntax:**

     - Bucketing is defined during table creation using the `CLUSTERED BY` clause.

     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE employee_bucketed (
         emp_id INT,
         emp_name STRING,
         emp_salary FLOAT
     )
     CLUSTERED BY (emp_id) INTO 8 BUCKETS;
     ```

   - **Example:**
     - If the `employee_bucketed` table is bucketed by the `emp_id` column into 8 buckets, data will be distributed into these buckets based on the hash value of `emp_id`.

4. **Advantages of Bucketing:**

   - **Efficient Sampling:**

     - Bucketing facilitates efficient sampling of data. For example, if a query involves a condition on the `emp_id` column, Hive can determine which bucket(s) to read, reducing the amount of data scanned.

   - **Join Optimization:**

     - Bucketing can optimize join operations. When two tables are bucketed on the join key, Hive can perform the join more efficiently by matching corresponding buckets, reducing the need to shuffle data across the cluster.

   - **Predictable Query Performance:**
     - Bucketing helps maintain a more predictable query performance, especially when queries involve conditions on the bucketed column.

5. **Combining Partitioning and Bucketing:**

   - It's possible to use both partitioning and bucketing in a Hive table. For example, a table can be partitioned by date and bucketed by user ID, allowing for efficient querying and sampling.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE combined_table (
       emp_id INT,
       emp_name STRING,
       emp_salary FLOAT
   )
   PARTITIONED BY (date STRING)
   CLUSTERED BY (user_id) INTO 8 BUCKETS;
   ```
