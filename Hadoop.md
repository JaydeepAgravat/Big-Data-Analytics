## Basics of Hadoop

- Hadoop is an open-source framework designed for distributed storage and processing of large datasets using a cluster of commodity hardware.
- Hadoop has become a cornerstone in the field of big data, enabling organizations to store, process, and analyze vast amounts of data efficiently and cost-effectively.
- It consists of two main components:

1. **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS):**

   - A distributed file system that breaks down large files into smaller blocks and stores copies of these blocks across multiple nodes in a cluster. This provides fault tolerance and enables parallel processing.

2. **MapReduce:**
   - A programming model for processing and generating large datasets in parallel. It divides tasks into smaller sub-tasks and distributes them across the nodes in the Hadoop cluster. It consists of two phases: the Map phase for data processing and the Reduce phase for summarization and aggregation.

- **Key Concepts:**

  - **Nodes:** Individual machines (commodity hardware) in the Hadoop cluster.
  - **JobTracker:** Manages and schedules MapReduce jobs in the cluster.
  - **TaskTracker:** Executes tasks assigned by the JobTracker on individual nodes.
  - **NameNode:** Manages the metadata and namespace of files in HDFS.
  - **DataNode:** Stores data blocks and executes read/write requests in HDFS.
  - **Ecosystem:** Hadoop has a rich ecosystem of related projects like Hive, Pig, Spark, and HBase, extending its capabilities for various data processing needs.

## Advantage & Disadvantage of Hadoop

8. **Reduced Competitiveness:**
   - Organizations that successfully leverage big data analytics gain a competitive edge. Without Hadoop, many businesses might have struggled to keep up with competitors in terms of data-driven decision-making and innovation.

## Hadoop Distributed File System

- Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is a storage system designed for storing and managing large datasets in a distributed manner.
- It is a crucial component of the Hadoop ecosystem.

- **Key Characteristics:**

  - **Distributed Storage:** Breaks large files into smaller blocks and stores them across multiple machines in a cluster.
  - **Fault Tolerance:** Replicates data blocks to ensure reliability, even if some nodes fail.
  - **Scalability:** Scales horizontally by adding more machines to the cluster.

- **Example:** Imagine you have a huge video file. HDFS would break it into smaller chunks (blocks) and distribute those chunks across different machines in your Hadoop cluster. This not only enables efficient storage but also allows for parallel processing of the data.

### HDFS Master-Slave Architecture

- HDFS follows a master-slave architecture where there are two main components: the NameNode (master) and DataNodes (slaves).

- **NameNode:**
  - Manages metadata and keeps track of the file system namespace.
  - Stores information about the structure of files and directories.
- **DataNodes:**

  - Store actual data in the form of blocks.
  - Report to the NameNode about the list of blocks they are storing.

- **Example:** Think of the NameNode as the librarian who maintains the catalog of all the books (blocks) in the library. DataNodes are like shelves, each storing a subset of the books.

### HDFS Core Components

- HDFS consists of several core components that work together to store and manage data:

1. **NameNode:**

   - Manages metadata and namespace of the file system.

2. **DataNode:**

   - Stores actual data blocks and communicates with the NameNode.

3. **Secondary NameNode:**
   - Performs periodic checkpoints of the namespace and helps in recovery.

- **Example:** In a library analogy, the NameNode is the librarian, DataNodes are the shelves, and the Secondary NameNode is an assistant librarian who helps in keeping track of books.

### Hadoop Cluster

- A Hadoop cluster is a collection of interconnected computers (nodes) that work together to process and analyze large datasets.

- **Key Characteristics:**

  - **Nodes:** Individual machines in the cluster.
  - **Task Distribution:** Divides tasks among nodes for parallel processing.
  - **Scalability:** Can be easily expanded by adding more nodes.

- **Example:** Think of a Hadoop cluster as a team of workers in a warehouse. Each worker (node) is responsible for a specific task, and they collaborate to efficiently process and manage a large inventory (dataset).

### HDFS Write Architecture

- When data is written to HDFS, it goes through a process involving the client, NameNode, and DataNodes.

- **Steps:**

  1. **Client Request:** The client requests to write a file to HDFS.
  2. **NameNode Interaction:** The client contacts the NameNode to get information about available DataNodes.
  3. **Data Write:** The client writes data to multiple DataNodes in parallel.

- **Example:** Imagine you are writing a story. The NameNode helps you find different notebooks (DataNodes) where you can write different parts of the story concurrently.

### HDFS Write Pipeline

- The write pipeline is the sequence of steps taken during the writing of data to HDFS.

- **Key Steps:**

  1. **Client to NameNode:** Client gets a list of DataNodes from the NameNode.
  2. **Data Stream Creation:** Client creates a pipeline to stream data to multiple DataNodes.
  3. **Concurrent Writing:** Data is simultaneously written to multiple DataNodes.

- **Example:** Think of writing a letter to multiple friends. Instead of writing each copy separately, you create a pipeline, and each friend receives their own letter concurrently.

### Data Streaming & Replication

- Data streaming involves the continuous flow of data from the client to multiple DataNodes during the write process.
- Replication is the duplication of data blocks for fault tolerance.

- **Example:** If you are streaming a live video, data is continuously sent from the source to multiple servers to ensure that even if one server fails, the video is still available.

### Shutdown of Pipeline or Acknowledgement Stage

- After data is written to multiple DataNodes, the client informs the NameNode about the successful write.

- **Steps:**

  1. **Client to NameNode:** Client informs the NameNode about successful data write.
  2. **Acknowledgment:** NameNode acknowledges the successful write.
  3. **Pipeline Shutdown:** The write pipeline is closed.

- **Example:** When you finish writing different parts of a story in notebooks, you inform the librarian (NameNode) that you have completed the task, and the librarian acknowledges your successful contribution to the story.

## Hadoop Ecosystem

- The Hadoop ecosystem is a collection of open-source tools, frameworks, and libraries built around the Hadoop core components. It extends the capabilities of Hadoop for various data processing, storage, and analysis needs.

## Map Reduce

### Developing a MapReduce Application

- Developing a MapReduce application involves creating a program that can process and analyze large datasets using the MapReduce programming model. It typically consists of two main functions: the Map function for processing input data, and the Reduce function for aggregating and summarizing the results.

- **Key Steps:**

  1. **Map Function Implementation:** Defines how to process each input record.
  2. **Reduce Function Implementation:** Specifies how to combine and process the output of the Map function.
  3. **Input and Output Configuration:** Specifies the input and output formats for the MapReduce job.
  4. **Job Configuration:** Defines various parameters for the MapReduce job, such as the number of reducers and input/output paths.
  5. **Testing and Debugging:** Involves thorough testing and debugging of the MapReduce program.

- **Example:** Consider a word count application. The Map function could tokenize each input line into words and emit key-value pairs (word, 1). The Reduce function would then sum up the counts for each word to get the total occurrences.

### MapReduce Architecture

- MapReduce architecture comprises a master (JobTracker) and worker nodes (TaskTrackers). The master is responsible for job coordination, while workers execute map and reduce tasks.

- **Components:**

  1. **JobTracker:** Manages job scheduling and task assignment.
  2. **TaskTracker:** Executes map and reduce tasks on worker nodes.
  3. **Mapper:** Processes input data and produces intermediate key-value pairs.
  4. **Reducer:** Aggregates and processes intermediate key-value pairs to generate the final output.

- **Example:** Imagine you are organizing a team to count books in a library. You (JobTracker) assign specific shelves (TaskTrackers) to team members (Mappers) to count books. Another team member (Reducer) then consolidates the counts from each shelf to get the total book count.

### How MapReduce Works

- MapReduce processes data in two phases: the Map phase and the Reduce phase.

- **Map Phase:**

  1. **Input Splitting:** Divides input data into manageable chunks.
  2. **Map Task Execution:** Executes the Map function on each split, producing intermediate key-value pairs.
  3. **Shuffling and Sorting:** Organizes intermediate data by key to prepare for the Reduce phase.

- **Reduce Phase:**

  1. **Grouping:** Groups intermediate data by key.
  2. **Reduce Task Execution:** Executes the Reduce function on each group, producing the final output.

- **Example:** Imagine counting the occurrences of each word in a book. In the Map phase, different team members count words on specific pages. The results are then organized and handed over to another team member who tallies the occurrences in the Reduce phase.

### MapReduce Algorithm

- The MapReduce algorithm follows a structured process:

- **Map Algorithm:**

  1. **Input Processing:** Takes an input record and extracts relevant data.
  2. **Mapping:** Applies a function to the extracted data, emitting intermediate key-value pairs.

- **Reduce Algorithm:**

  1. **Grouping:** Groups intermediate data by key.
  2. **Reducing:** Applies a function to each group, producing the final output.

- **Example:** For a word count algorithm, the Map algorithm could tokenize each line into words and emit (word, 1) pairs. The Reduce algorithm would then sum up the counts for each word.

### MapReduce Features

- MapReduce offers several features that contribute to its effectiveness in processing large-scale data:

1. **Scalability:** Easily scales by adding more nodes to the cluster for parallel processing.
2. **Fault Tolerance:** Can recover from node failures, ensuring job completion.
3. **Data Locality:** Moves computation to the data, minimizing data transfer across the network.
4. **Ease of Use:** Provides a high-level abstraction for developers, simplifying parallel programming.
5. **Versatility:** Applicable to a wide range of data processing tasks, from simple counting to complex analytics.

- **Example:** Think of a MapReduce job as a team of workers counting different types of items in a warehouse. They can efficiently scale by adding more workers, continue counting even if some workers take breaks, and prioritize counting items in the same section to minimize movement. The manager (JobTracker) oversees the overall process, making sure everything runs smoothly.

### Brief Anatomy of a Map Reduce Job run and Failures

#### Anatomy of a MapReduce Job Run

1. **Job Submission:**

   - Users submit MapReduce jobs to the Hadoop cluster. The job includes the input data location, the Map and Reduce functions, and other configuration details.

2. **Job Initialization:**

   - The JobTracker, a master node, receives the job and initiates the process. It divides the input data into splits and assigns them to individual Mapper tasks.

3. **Map Phase Execution:**

   - Mapper tasks run in parallel on different nodes. Each Mapper processes its input split and emits intermediate key-value pairs.

4. **Shuffle and Sort:**

   - The framework organizes the intermediate data by key and sends it to the appropriate Reducer nodes. This involves shuffling and sorting to group data with the same key.

5. **Reduce Phase Execution:**

   - Reducer tasks receive grouped data and apply the Reduce function to produce the final output.

6. **Output Generation:**
   - The final output is stored in HDFS or another specified location. The completed job status is reported back to the client.

#### Failures in MapReduce Job Run

1. **Task Failure:**

   - Individual Map or Reduce tasks may fail due to various reasons such as hardware issues, software bugs, or data corruption.

2. **Node Failure:**

   - If a node containing task trackers fails, the JobTracker reschedules the affected tasks on other healthy nodes to ensure completion.

3. **Network Failure:**

   - Communication failures between nodes can occur. Redundancy and retries help mitigate the impact of such failures.

4. **JobTracker Failure:**

   - If the JobTracker fails, a secondary JobTracker or a standby takes over to ensure job continuity.

5. **Data Node Failure:**

   - If a DataNode fails, HDFS replication ensures data availability by retrieving the lost data from replicated copies on other nodes.

6. **Task Execution Timeouts:**

   - Tasks may time out if they take longer than expected. Proper configuration settings and optimizations can address this issue.

7. **Resource Exhaustion:**

   - Inadequate resources, such as memory or CPU, can lead to task failures. Monitoring and resource allocation adjustments help prevent this.

8. **Application Bugs:**
   - Bugs in user-defined Map and Reduce functions or incorrect job configurations can result in job failures.

#### Mitigation Strategies for Failures

1. **Task Retry Mechanism:**

   - Configure MapReduce to automatically retry failed tasks.

2. **Data Replication:**

   - Increase data replication in HDFS to ensure data availability in case of node failures.

3. **Monitoring and Alerts:**

   - Implement monitoring tools to detect failures and set up alerts for timely intervention.

4. **Fault-Tolerant Design:**

   - Develop Map and Reduce functions with fault tolerance in mind to handle unexpected issues gracefully.

5. **JobTracker High Availability:**

   - Configure multiple JobTracker instances for high availability in case of a primary JobTracker failure.

6. **Regular Maintenance:**
   - Conduct regular cluster maintenance, including hardware checks, software updates, and resource optimizations.

- Understanding the anatomy of a MapReduce job run and potential failures is crucial for efficient big data processing and maintaining the reliability of Hadoop clusters.
