   - **Example:** If you have a list of numbers (data) representing daily sales, the total sales for a month calculated from that list would be information.

- In essence, data is the input that a computer works with, and information is the meaningful output or result obtained after processing and interpreting that data.
- The transformation from data to information involves organizing, analyzing, and contextualizing the raw data to make it useful for decision-making or understanding a particular context.

### Big Data

- Big data refers to extremely large and complex sets of data that traditional data processing applications are not well-suited to handle.
- While there isn't a strict size threshold for big data, it is often characterized by the three Vs: Volume, Velocity, and Variety.
- When datasets become too large, too fast, or too complex for traditional systems to manage effectively, they are typically considered as falling into the world of big data.
- The actual size that qualifies as "big" can vary depending on the context and the capabilities of available technology. For some, a dataset in the terabyte or petabyte range may be considered big data.

### Sources of Big Data
